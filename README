Context:
This code was developed and used in the author’s master’s dissertation:

Wave packet propagation in phosphorene grain boundaries
http://repositorio.ufc.br/handle/riufc/33439
(Master’s dissertation, written in Portuguese)

General Description
-------------------

This program computes the time evolution of wave packets using the
split-operator method. The numerical approach follows the methodology
described in:

Communications in Computational Physics 17 (3), 850–866.

The code was extended to treat polycrystalline two-dimensional materials
within the effective-mass model, with a particular focus on scattering
problems. While originally designed for phosphorene grain boundaries,
the implementation is general and can be adapted to simpler systems
involving external potentials.

An example of a step potential is included.

Scope and Limitations
---------------------

The current implementation is intended for:
- Time-dependent wave-packet propagation
- Scattering problems in two-dimensional systems

The following topics are not addressed:
- Bound-state problems
- Imaginary-time evolution for obtaining eigenstates and eigenvalues

Extending the code to handle these cases would require additional
modifications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation
------------

To build the code, go to the src/ directory and run:

  make

This will generate the executable:

  split_operator

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the Code
----------------

If the executable is in your PATH, run the simulation as:

  split_operator inputfile.inp

An example input file is provided in the examples/ directory.

The program writes binary snapshot data that can be post-processed for
visualization and analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-processing and Visualization
---------------------------------

The tools/ directory contains a Python wrapper for plotting wave-packet
trajectories from the generated binary snapshot files. This wrapper can
be used to produce individual frames and animations of the wave-packet
evolution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Planned / Ongoing Development
-----------------------------

Additional analysis and visualization features are planned or under
development, including:

- Composite figures showing multiple snapshots of the wave packet in a
  single image
- Expectation values of the wave-packet center-of-mass position
- Expectation values of the wave-packet center-of-mass velocity
- Reflection and transmission probabilities

These features are not yet fully integrated into the current toolchain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Intended Use
------------

This code was developed as a research tool for studying quantum transport
and scattering phenomena in two-dimensional materials. While it was
tested and validated in the context of a master’s dissertation, further
validation and adaptation may be required for other physical systems or
numerical applications.
